# Auto Expert

Auto Expert is a Python tool that helps diagnose vehicle issues based on user-provided symptoms. It uses AI to suggest possible problems and causes in a clear, structured format.

## Tools Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application interface.
- **LangChain**: To manage and structure AI prompts and responses.
- **Google Generative AI**: For generating AI-based recommendations and solutions.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.

## Backend

The backend of this project is powered by Google Generative AI, integrated using the LangChain framework. It processes user inputs (vehicle details and symptoms) and generates structured outputs, including problem diagnosis, possible causes, recommended solutions, and maintenance tips. The backend also uses Streamlit to handle user input forms and display results interactively.
